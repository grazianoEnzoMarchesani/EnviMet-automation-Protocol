# Abstract
The integration of environmental modeling with ENVI-met in the context of the LIFE A_GreeNET project faces the challenge of a considerable number of simulations due to the breadth of the areas under examination and the complexity of the variables involved. This circumstance necessitates the development of a standardization protocol to streamline the creation of a variety of models. The realization of such a protocol transcends the simple pursuit of efficiency, proving essential to ensure methodological coherence and the reliability of results obtained through the various simulations.  In the realm of environmental modeling, the time factor assumes critical relevance. Projects require the rapid processing and analysis of multiple scenarios to understand the impacts derived from various types of environmental interventions. This urgency underscores the need for a protocol that, in addition to simplifying the model generation process, guarantees their integrity and accuracy.  In this context, the first chapter of the protocol is dedicated to establishing clear and rigorous guidelines for the creation and management of environmental models in ENVI-met. It aims to provide users with a set of tools and procedures that not only speed up the modeling process but also ensure the consistency and replicability of models on a large scale. Emphasis is placed on defining standards for data structuring, layer naming, and geometric coherence, all crucial elements for the validity and effectiveness of the generated models.  Strategies for the effective management of modeling workflows will also be explored, addressing topics such as optimizing the use of computational resources and integrating innovative methodologies for data processing. The chapter, therefore, proposes itself as a fundamental guide for professionals and researchers operating in the field of environmental modeling, providing them with the foundations to build accurate, efficient simulations that adhere to the specific needs of the LIFE A_GreeNET project.
